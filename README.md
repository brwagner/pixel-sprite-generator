======================

Port of Zfedoran's sprite generator to Unity.

##Example

##Algorithm
The sprites are generated by using a two dimensional mask. The values in the mask are then randomized and mirrored. The resulting template is rendered to a canvas element.

##Installation
Copy Assets/PixelSpriteGenerator.cs into your project. Masks can be generated from data arrays and csv files. See Assets/Example.cs for example syntax.
